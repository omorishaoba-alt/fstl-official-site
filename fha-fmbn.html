            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Federal Housing Authority (FHA) and Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) are pivotal institutions for housing finance. However, their current operations are largely inefficient, underfunded, and focused on limited sectors. FSTL proposes structural reforms to maximize their impact on Nigeria’s housing deficit.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Current Challenges</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>FHA:</strong> Primarily focused on low-income housing, with limited capacity for large-scale projects; inefficient allocation of housing funds.</li>
                <li><strong>FMBN:</strong> Operates as a purely secondary market institution with minimal liquidity creation for the broader mortgage ecosystem.</li>
                <li>Both agencies lack integration with modern credit instruments and market-based funding like municipal bonds.</li>
                <li>Inadequate alignment with global mortgage practices (e.g., G7 markets, Fannie Mae/Ginnie Mae model).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Proposed Reforms</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Adopt Fannie Mae & Ginnie Mae style securitization for FMBN to create secondary market liquidity.</li>
                <li>FHA to focus exclusively on low-income housing while partnering with private sector for mid-to-high income segments.</li>
                <li>Introduce modern credit culture, leveraging title guarantee, mortgage insurance, and hire-purchase credit.</li>
                <li>Integrate FHA & FMBN operations with municipal bonds and infrastructure bonds to fund affordable housing.</li>
                <li>Enhance digital cadastral systems and blockchain-based verification to streamline title and mortgage approval.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Expand mortgage lending to reach more households and developers.</li>
                <li>Increase transparency and reduce default risk in housing finance.</li>
                <li>Mobilize private and institutional capital for housing development.</li>
                <li>Create a sustainable mortgage market culture aligned with international standards.</li>
                <li>Support economic growth via credit expansion and housing industrialization.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
