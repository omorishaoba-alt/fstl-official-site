  <h3>Title Risk Assessment Report (TRAR™)</h3>

    The <strong>Title Risk Assessment Report (TRAR™)</strong> is a structured professional analysis

  </p>

  <h3>Mortgage Readiness & Title Cleanliness Certification (MRTC™)</h3>
  <p>
    The <strong>Mortgage Readiness & Title Cleanliness Certification (MRTC™)</strong> confirms that
    a property title meets the legal and risk standards required for mortgage financing,
    institutional investment, or structured development.
